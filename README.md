# ClassCheck 
## Python 2.6
This script checks the UMass classes on Spire through your Shopping Cart Repeatedly

What it does is it uses your account to access your shopping cart and retrieves your classes in your
shopping cart repeatedly until a specified class is open to be enrolled.
This removes the problem for students to repeatedly check Spire for open classes.
